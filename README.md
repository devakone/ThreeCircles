We're presenting you the work done by [3musket33rs](http://3musket33rs.github.com/) team.

## Step1: Scaffolding
### Setup
Fork this repo
### Get source code from repo
```java
git checkout step1_todo
```
In this branch there is only one grails command that has been executed
```java
grails create-app ThreeCircles
```
Now let's start configuring and scaffolding all the classes we need
### BuildConfig.groovy
add
```java
  grails.plugin.location."html5-mobile-scaffolding" = "../html5-mobile-scaffolding"
  grails.plugin.location."phonegapbuild" = "../phonegapbuild"
```
in plugins
```java
    plugins {
        runtime ":hibernate:$grailsVersion"
        runtime ":jquery:1.9.1"
        runtime ":resources:1.1.6"
        build ":tomcat:$grailsVersion"
        runtime ":database-migration:1.1"
        compile ':cache:1.0.0'
        compile ":webxml:1.4.1"
    }
```
in UrlMappings.groovy
remove
```java
    "/"(view:"/index")
```
### Create domain classes
```java
grails create-domain-class User
grails create-domain-class Place
grails create-domain-class Comment
grails create-domain-class Checkin
```
edit generated domain class and add content according to class diagram
![class diagram](https://github.com/fabricematrat/ThreeCircles/raw/master/imagesTutorial/classDiagram.png "class diagram")

### Generate HTML5 scaffolding for both controller and views
```java
grails html-generate-all User
grails html-generate-all Place
grails html-generate-all Comment
grails html-generate-all Checkin
```
### Run the app
```java
grails run-app
```

### Get source code from repo
Before you get the solution push your changes
```java
git add -a -m "your changes"
git push
```
and if you want to check the solution
```java
git checkout step1_done
```
## Step2: Boostrap
### Get source code from repo
```java
git checkout step2_todo
```
and search for TODO in files

### In BootStrap.groovy
- add several users
- add some places
```java
        Place wien = new Place(name: "Wein", 
                               latitude:48.217349004974416, 
                               longitude: 16.407538767645292, 
                               address:  "Messe Wien Exhibition & Congress " )
        wien.save()
```
- add a checkin at confess!

### Run the app
```java
grails run-app
```

### Get source code from repo
```java
git checkout step2_done
```

[Solution Step2](https://github.com/fabricematrat/solution_step2.md)

## Step3: Render timeline with mock picture

### Get source code from repo
```java
git checkout step3_todo
```
you will get new folders and files containing mock screen for timeline
- web-app/css/my.css
- web-app/img/
-	web-app/index_mock.html
-	web-app/js/my.js

### Main page: timeline
- delete index.html
- rename checkin-index.html into index.html

### Transform your index.html with css
- add import css file 
- In section with id "section-list-checkin" add header as shown in index-mockup.html
- revisit footer

### Display dynamic content
- for the callback associated to that.model.listedItems event, write rendering of timeline (search for //TODO render timeline)
Put a breakpoint in checkin-view.js in callback attached to that.model.listedItems 
- Is it rendering as expected? 
- In CheckinController.groovy add deep relationship resolution for **as JSON** (search for //TODO deep relation)

### Get source code from repo
```java
git checkout step3_done
```

## Step4: Get timeline with time information

### Get source code from repo
```java
git checkout step4_todo
```
You will get a new file timeline.js that you will complete for the time information.
### Add JS file timeline.js
- go to timeline.js
Note 3muket33rs JS coding Ã  la Crockford (function first!).
Add a method which take a Date as long and returned information like just now, 11 minutes ago, 2 days ago, 3 months ago
- go to checkin-view.js (search for //TODO) add call to newly created method to add time information.
- go to index.html to include new js file

### Get source code from repo
```java
git checkout step4_done
```

## Step5: Google places

### Get source code from repo
```java
git checkout step5_todo
```
- You will get a new file geolocation.js that you will complete for the time information.
- In index.html, include google API, section with id "section-show-checkin" has been refactored to apply CSS and match our use case
- In checkin-view.js, we initialize our map with
```java
    $("#section-show-checkin").on( "pageshow", function (event) {
        geolocationSearch.showMapWithPlaces('map_canvas2', "list-place", storeLatLng);
    });
```
### In geolocation.js seach // TODO search places
In this method

- create map from canvas id

Use Google API: [google.maps.Map](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference#Map)

- once navigator got our current position, use google places API

HTML5 navigator.geolocation, to get current position

Use Google places API: [google.maps.places](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference#PlacesService)

Use Google geometry API: [google.maps.geometry.spherical](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference#spherical)

Use Google Marker API: [google.maps.Marker](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference#Marker)

Use Google position API: [google.maps.LatLng](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference#LatLng)

### Get source code from repo

```java
git checkout step5_done
```
## Step6: Checkin!

### Get source code from repo
```java
git checkout step6_todo
```
- In index.html, section with id "checkin" has been refactored to apply CSS and match our use case
- In checkin-view.js, we initialize our third map (canvas_map3) with
```java
    $("#checkin").on( "pageshow", function (event) {
        geolocationCheckin.showMap('map_canvas3', that.selectedPlace);
    });
```
- In checkin-view.js, *addAndSort* method added to render timelinewith latest checkin first.
- In geolocation.js, uses [google info window](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference#InfoWindow) to render bubble.

### Add behaviour on button id  "checkin-submit"
- search for // TODO on checkin submit
- format the object before sending
```java
            {
               checkin: "{
                  description: description,
                  'owner.id': "1",
                   place: placeObj,
                  when: new Date().getTime()
               }"
           }
```

### CheckinController.groovy, 
- once a place is found with Google Places, save it to ThreeCircles database.
- look at event method that trigger the event push

### On created, in checkin-view.js, deal with event push

Event push (Grails plugin using Atmosphere framework) is doing broadcast to all browsers.  
3musketeers PushManager is dealing with excluding "myself". In order to know in your code if you're the one triggering 
created callback you can user the NOTIFIED tag. NOTIFIED boolean is set when you are notidied of somebody else event.

```java
   if (!data.item.NOTIFIED) {
     // I'm being notified of a new checkin
   }  else {
     // I've just checked in successfully
   }
```
### On created, in checkin-view.js
- add clear text area to resetForm method

### Get source code from repo
```java
git checkout step6_done
```
## Step7: Let's take a picture

### Get source code from repo
```java
git checkout step7_todo
```
### Add a new attribute in Checkin.groovy search for // TODO picture
- By convention every attribute of type "byte[]" is considerer as a photo, html5-mobile-scaffolding will scaffold all needed for deling with photo
- Photo is optional and are big. See add to define [constraints](http://grails.org/doc/latest/ref/Constraints/Usage.html) in Grails.
- No need to re-generate scaffolded view: be carefull not to loose all your work on checkin view!

### in geolocation.js, 
- add in the bubble window, take a pciture button

### in checkin-view.js,
- on checkin-submit click send picture within the form
- modify createListItemCustom to dispplay picture if present
- On created, add clear file input to resetForm method

### Get source code from repo
```java
git checkout step7_done
```

## Step8: Put all together

### Get source code from repo
```java
git checkout step8_done
```



## Step9: Logging with Spring-Security

### Get source code from repo
```java
git checkout step9_todo
```
You get spring-security-core installed, seein BuildConfig:
```java
plugins {
  ...
  compile ":webxml:1.4.1"
  compile ':spring-security-core:1.2.7.3'
}
```
Run run-app to fetch dependecies and install SpringSecurity

### Create User and UserRole domain class 
```java
grails s2-quickstart threecircles User Role
```

### Get source code from repo
```java
git checkout step9_done
```



package threecircles

class User {
    String firstname
    String lastname
    String username
    String password

    static hasMany = [friends:User]

    static constraints = {
    }
}
